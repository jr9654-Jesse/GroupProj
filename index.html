                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Shopping, both virtually and in-store, takes time and can be mentally overloading. Currently, there is no centralized space that allows shoppers to collect clothing from different stores. Additionally, shoppers are unable to fully visualize outfits before buying which can lead to mismatched outfits and unnecessary purchases. This burden falls on the consumer to return unwanted items, in-store or through postal services, and waiting for reimbursement.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2 border-b pb-2 border-gray-200">Problem Statement</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">Personal styling and online shopping are currently independent experiences and require a lot of time and mental energy. While the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and augmented reality (AR) have contributed to tools that allow online shoppers to visualize the outfits virtually prior to purchasing [1], there is no commercially available platform that allows shoppers to:</p>

                        <li>Manage their existing wardrobe and styles, virtually</li>
                        <li>Collect and experiment with different outfit combinations from different brands online</li>
                        <li>Sell old garments and pieces to other buyers</li>
                        <li>See how they look on themselves through AR</li>
                        <li>Compare sizes, designs, quality and cost between brands</li>
                        <li>Place their order for the selected items.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2 border-b pb-2 border-gray-200">Solution</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">Wishlist Wardrobe is a consolidated platform that combines personal styling and planning with efficient online shopping. Supported by emerging AI and AR tools, the goal is to provide one platform where customers can select from a wide range of clothing brands, mix-and-match pieces, visualize the outfit on themselves, save items for future purchases, and complete their online order.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-4">Building on previous work in this area [2], Wishlist Wardrobe will use AI support to identify differences in sizing patterns between brands, recommend outfits based on the consumer’s need (professional, casual, formal, special event, etc.), and learn from previous trends to differentiate a potentially successful purchase from one that is likely to be returned.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-4">Additionally, there exists a need for users to social and environmental need for users to resell their clothing items [3]. This can be alleviated by giving users the ability to resell their clothing online alongside new items allowing users to match similar styles for a lower price and in a environmentally conscious way.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-4">The platform can also use a camera or recent picture to recommend clothing sizes and learn from consumers’ product reviews to suggest if/when to size up or size down.</p>

                        <li>For both online and in-store shopping, shoppers admit that they consistently return to familiar brands and retailers to alleviate obstacles such as fit, style familiarity, and material quality.</li>
                        <li>Customer reviews are trusted by shoppers as a primary source of information related to determining the correct size, and quality. When shopping for unfamiliar brands, customer reviews are even more heavily relied on. </li>

                    <p class="text-gray-700">Of the participants we interviewed, there was a split between shopping enthusiasts and people who shop for necessity rather than enjoyment. The former group struggled less with time and more with efficiency. As they are familiar with the platforms and spend a significant amount of time on them, their main concerns were not being able to keep track of the items they liked in the way that was most helpful to them, and not being sure about sizing and quality with new brands that did not have enough customer reviews or brand media. For the latter group,time pressures were a recurring issue which led to incomplete outfit purchases, overspending due to rushed decisions, and settling for items out of convenience rather than desired items.</p>

                                <li>Online shopping did not lead to a reduction in fatigue, stress, and feeling overwhelmed despite the convenience.</li>

                                <li>Although shoppers have access to coupons and discounts, shoppers were reluctant to use them due to the inconvenience of locating and applying them. The time and effort required outweighed their perceived savings.</li>

This allowed the team to have a larger sample size and collect data from a diverse sample. To improve our inquiries in the future, it would be beneficial to conduct a contextual inquiry session with all the team members observing the same participant. Multiple observers would be able to capture subtle behaviors, emotional reactions, and follow-up questions an individual observer may have missed.

                    <p class="text-gray-700">Our contextual inquiries revealed that while online shopping provides convenience, it often leads to <strong>cognitive overload and increased stress</strong>, particularly with sizing and product comparison. We determined that both novice and experienced shoppers encounter similar challenges and pain points. These observations reinforce the need for <strong>more personalized and adaptive shopping tools</strong> and will provide guidance for our design solutions to improve and simplify the shopping experience for all users.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Our contextual inquiry observations revealed that users get frustrated at multiple stages in the process of online shopping. Depending on their needs and goals, they are shopping with different timelines, for themselves or others, across multiple websites when desired items are not available on one platform, and they experience challenges with assembling whole outfits that can be visualized before purchasing, and tracked separately depending on whom they are intended for. Returning items is also a concern and a time-consuming task. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            The collection of these observations and concerns led us to select a task analysis model, specifically a hierarchical task analysis to define the series of steps users follow while shopping online. From searching for desired items to completing transactions and managing orders/returns, the hierarchical task analysis allows us to visualize the complete user experience and design our platform accordingly. We also include considerations for cognitive load and their impact on our design to demonstrate how our platform aims to address issues discovered during contextual inquiry observations, represented by our personas.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Marcus is a full-time fashion consultant who enjoys shopping and curating outfits for his multiple clients and himself. He frequently shops online and in-store across a variety of platforms to build complete outfits and client collections. He is frustrated with tracking, comparing, and organizing pieces from various websites to build an entire look. Marcus wants a single platform to compare, curate, and share his visions with clients.</p>
