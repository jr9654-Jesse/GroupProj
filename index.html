                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Shopping, both virtually and in-store, takes time and can be mentally overloading. Currently, there is no centralized space that allows shoppers to collect clothing from different stores. Additionally, shoppers are unable to fully visualize outfits before buying which can lead to mismatched outfits and unnecessary purchases. This burden falls on the consumer to return unwanted items, in-store or through postal services, and waiting for reimbursement.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2 border-b pb-2 border-gray-200">Problem Statement</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">Personal styling and online shopping are currently independent experiences and require a lot of time and mental energy. While the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and augmented reality (AR) have contributed to tools that allow online shoppers to visualize the outfits virtually prior to purchasing [1], there is no commercially available platform that allows shoppers to:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-600">
                        <li>Manage their existing wardrobe and styles, virtually</li>
                        <li>Collect and experiment with different outfit combinations from different brands online</li>
                        <li>Sell old garments and pieces to other buyers</li>
                        <li>See how they look on themselves through AR</li>
                        <li>Compare sizes, designs, quality and cost between brands</li>
                        <li>Place their order for the selected items.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2 border-b pb-2 border-gray-200">Solution</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">Wishlist Wardrobe is a consolidated platform that combines personal styling and planning with efficient online shopping. Supported by emerging AI and AR tools, the goal is to provide one platform where customers can select from a wide range of clothing brands, mix-and-match pieces, visualize the outfit on themselves, save items for future purchases, and complete their online order.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-4">Building on previous work in this area [2], Wishlist Wardrobe will use AI support to identify differences in sizing patterns between brands, recommend outfits based on the consumer’s need (professional, casual, formal, special event, etc.), and learn from previous trends to differentiate a potentially successful purchase from one that is likely to be returned.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-4">Additionally, there exists a need for users to social and environmental need for users to resell their clothing items [3]. This can be alleviated by giving users the ability to resell their clothing online alongside new items allowing users to match similar styles for a lower price and in a environmentally conscious way.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-4">The platform can also use a camera or recent picture to recommend clothing sizes and learn from consumers’ product reviews to suggest if/when to size up or size down.</p>

Notes:
Raw:
•
Participant is browsing online (Social Media) for clothing items that interest her.
An Jacket from Fashion Nova page on Instagram catches her eye
Participant opens Fashion Nova link for a Jacket she saw advertised on Instagram
Click on links -> Opens webpage -> clicks option to open in-app
Examines jacket images then adds to wishlist
0
Selects image and saves to camera roll
Closes Fashion Nova app and opens Snapchat

•
•
Opens saved image from camera roll on Snapchat
0 Uses Snapchat "cutout" tool to select then save selected image as a digital
sticker within Snapchat (tool appears to automatically cut out garment only and
 removes background details)
Participant then proceeds to cover camera on the back and takes a black photo
 0 Goes to saved stickers on Snapchat
Saved sticker from the image she selected earlier is on there
There also appears to be other saved stickers of garments too (possibly from
 previous iterations prior to inquiry)
0
Participant then drags, resizes, and drops stickers of garments along with other
 previously saved stickers of garments to create a makeshift outfit within
 snapchat.
O Participant saves finished outfit snap onto Snapchat Memories.
Participant seems to do this fairly quickly, demonstrating proficiency with this workflow,
suggesting this activity is done frequently.
Participant then minimises Snapchat and opens web browser, searches "Pretty little
thing" on search engine
• Opens online website for female fashion
• Participant searches for bags on search bar
Scrolls through list of handbags
Selects one bag that she likes, then repeats process for Fashion Nova (adds to
wishlist then saves image from website to camera roll)
0
Participant repeats process of saving as sticker on Snapchat
Opens previously saved snap memory of outfit, and adds saved sticker of
 handbag to the Snap.
• This appears to be a participant's version of Virtual try-on, and allows her to assess how
 different items, colors, and styles could potentially look together before purchasing.
•
I show her Tik Tok's Al powered image manipulation feature for making it look like the
user is wearing the garment they're viewing by uploading a full body picture.
O User appears astounded, and enthusiastically wishes this feature was more
 ubiquitous on online fashion sites.
Specific Questions Asked (Include Context):
1. (When user long presses the image and saves to the camera roll) Why did you save the
image of the jacket to your camera roll when you already added it to your wishlist?
a. "I like to save them to my camera roll too so I can see it again and to share
online. I also use Snapchat to put my outfits together and share them online."
2. (I asked her) That's really interesting! Can you show me how you do that?
a. "Yeah, so basically on Shap you can turn images into stickers by selecting them
so I just take a saved image, then cut it out there, save it as a sticker, then take a
black picture like this (covers camera to take a black picture), then I just drag and
drop the stickers on there to create a virtual outfit."
3. So basically you turn each image of a garment into a sticker for you to assemble into a
new outfit later?
a. "Yeee, I do this for all my fits! I always save them as Snapchat stickers then put them together to see how it looks. I also have other saved stickers too of outfits, it's a fun way to pass time at work!"
4. Is there any specific order you start with when creating an outfit idea?
a. "I usually start with shoes then build the outfit around them, but sometimes I start with Jacket or anything I find cool online too"
b. (Participant goes through Snapchat Memories showcasing previously made outfits) "See? I do this for all my fits! I always save them on Snapchat as stickers, them put them together and see how it looks"
5. (Out of curiosity, I decided to touch up on the concept of Al for Virtual try on tools) This is a very interesting system you built. How familiar are you with other virtual fitting tools besides this, specifically Al powered ones that could automate this process?
a. "I haven't really tried too many, but I've seen some on websites, like Nike where I got this idea from."
b. "I'm not too familiar with Al, but if it could make it easier I'm all for it."
6. (I show her an example from Tiktok which uses Al powered image manipulation to make users look like they're wearing a garment on the shop)
a. "Yo this is pretty cool! I cant believe they can do that now! This is the one thing I wish existed on all fashion apps so I can see what it looks like before I buy it!"

was button-up shirts.
Process:
Scrolled through the clothing options (no filters)
Selected a few to look at in more detail, then either:
Went back to main search screen,
Selected size and added to cart, or
Would sigh and go back to main search screen when correct size was not
available (Question 1)
Selected three shirts total
Took about 14 minutes to find 3 he liked and was also available in his size
Used search bar again to search for shorts
Same behaviors for shirts
More shorts on sale or clearance
Didn't use filter for size, style, or brand
More variations to look through (material, length, and short style)
Found a few he initially liked, but didn't know if the length would be too high

shorts he liked and were in his size
When checking out, didn't look for any additional discounts or promo codes (Question 4)
Didn't get everything he said he was looking for
End (Questions)
Specific Questions Asked (Include Context):
During:
1. While shopping for shirts: Are you able to find what you are looking for?
a. Kinda, just something that doesn't look too old or has too many
patterns.
A lot of these are not really my style and seem like they are
for older people.
They aren't something I would wear on vacation.
2. After they only used the Macys apps: Do you typically shop through the same stores?
a. Yes, I usually stick with what I know to make it easier, not a big shopper so I like to just get it done.
I don't really shop for particular brands, just style and size that fit their body type.
3. After last comment: Do you go in-stores to shop?
a. Sometimes.
When I shop in stores, I don't really try anything on.
Just convenience shop...if I see something I like I find my size and hope for the best.
i. What do you usually do if you don't like an item or it's the wrong size?
1. Take it back when I have the chance or when I remember too
4. Once they checked out: Do you use discount codes when you shop?
a. Sometimes, Macys will automatically apply promo codes if I am signed into my account.
I don't carry them with me or forget them if they aren't on my phone.
I would rather just be done than try and find them unless it is going to save me a decent amount of money.
i. Would having discounts and promo codes impact how you shop?
1. It depends, I probably won't go out of my way to go home and get them unless it saves a lot, but I'll try to remember to bring them if I know I'm going out shopping.
